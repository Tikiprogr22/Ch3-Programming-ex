				<h2>From humble roots, we grew to be Totally Awesome</h2>
				<p class="bolder">How It All Started</p>
				<p>We started this business in 2001 with a group of friends who shared a deep passion for unique and innovative products. It all started in a 
					small garage where they would gather after work to brainstorm ideas for creating an online 
					platform where people could discover and purchase the most incredible and unexpected items they could imagine. One fateful evening, as they snacked
					 on low-fat candy specially made for goldfish, inspiration struck. They envisioned a place where whimsical treats 
					like these could find a home alongside other amazing finds, leading to the birth of TotallyAwesomeStuff.com.</p>
				<br/>
				<p class="bolder">Growing Greater</p>
				<p>In 2003 we began to gain traction and capture the hearts of online shoppers with its wide array of products, including low-fat candy for goldfish, the team realized 
					they had tapped into something special. With a commitment to customer satisfaction and a dedication to sourcing the most unique and high-quality items, 
					the company's growth trajectory skyrocketed. 
					What started as a passion project among friends quickly transformed 
					into a thriving business venture, offering an ever-expanding selection of delightful 
					goodies that catered to every taste and preference.</p>
